# Bitrix infrastructure as a code [![Build Status](https://github.com/paskal/bitrix.infra/workflows/build/badge.svg)](https://github.com/paskal/bitrix.infra/actions/workflows/ci-build.yml) [![PHP Build Status](https://github.com/paskal/bitrix.infra/workflows/build-php/badge.svg)](https://github.com/paskal/bitrix.infra/actions/workflows/ci-build-php.yml) [![Pull Status](https://github.com/paskal/bitrix.infra/workflows/pull/badge.svg)](https://github.com/paskal/bitrix.infra/actions/workflows/ci-pull.yml)

This repository contains infrastructure code behind Bitrix-based site.

It's a Bitrix website completely enclosed within docker-compose to be as portable and maintainable as possible, and a set of scripts around its maintenance like dev site redeploy or production site backup.

## Is it fast?

You bet! Here is a performance on Yandex.Cloud server with Intel Cascade Lake 8 vCPUs, 16Gb of RAM and 120Gb SSD 4000 read\write IOPS and 60Mb/s bandwidth.

## How to make use of it

You couldn't use it as-is without alterations. However, I tried to make everything as generic as possible to make adoption for another project easy. To use it, read through [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml)
and then read the rest of this Readme.

After you make adjustments to configuration and docker-compose.yml, run it as follows:

```bash
docker-compose up --build -d
```

[bitrixdock](https://github.com/bitrixdock/bitrixdock) (Russian) project was an inspiration for this one and had way better setup instructions. Please start with it if you don't know what to do with many files in that repo.

### File system permissions

All files touched by MySQL use UID/GID 1001, and PHP and Nginx use UID/GID 1000. Running `scripts/fix-rights.sh` script would set the permissions appropriately for all containers to run correctly.

It might be easier to switch everything to User and Group 1000 for consistency later.

## File structure

### /config

- `cron/php-cron.cron` is a list of cron tasks to run in php-cron container, only `cron_events.php` is required for Bitrix and others are specific to this site,
  [must](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/trusty/man8/cron.8.html) be owned by root:root and have access rights 0644 - fixable by running `scripts/fix-rights.sh`

- `cron/host.cron` is a list of cron tasks to run on the host machine

- `mysql/my.cnf` is a MySQL configuration, applied on top of package-provided my.cnf

- `nginx` directory contains the build Dockerfile, as well as following (HTTPS) configuration:
    - bitrix proxy, separate for dev and prod
    - adminer proxy
    - HTTP to HTTPS redirects
    - stub status page listening on localhost for Zabbix monitoring

- `php-fpm` directory contains the build Dockerfile and php configuration, applied on top of package-provided one

### /logs

`mysql`, `nginx`, `php` logs. cron and msmtp logs will be written to the `php` directory.

### /scripts

Bunch of scripts, see their source code for purpose and comments.

### /web

Site files in directories `web/prod` and `web/dev`.

### /private

- `private/environment` is a directory with environment files for docker-compose

    - `private/environment/mysql.env` should contain the [following variables](https://hub.docker.com/r/percona/percona-server):

      ```bash
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=mysql_root_password
      MYSQL_USER=bitrix_user
      MYSQL_PASSWORD=bitrix_mysql_password
      ```

    - `private/environment/ftp.env` should contain the [following variables](https://hub.docker.com/r/stilliard/pure-ftpd):

## Routine operations

<details>
<summary>Disaster recovery</summary>

To start the recovery you should have a machine with the latest Ubuntu with static external IP with DDoS protection attached to it, created [in the Yandex.Cloud](https://console.cloud.yandex.ru/folders/b1gm2f812hg4h5s5jsgn/compute). It should be created with 100Gb of disk space, 12Gb of RAM and 8 cores.

SSH to the machine you want to set up as a new server and then execute the following, then follow the instructions of the script:

```shell
# that is preparation for backup restoration
sudo mkdir -p /web
sudo chown $USER:$(id -g -n) /web
sudo apt-get update >/dev/null
sudo apt-get -y install git >/dev/null
git clone https://github.com/paskal/bitrix.infra.git /web
cd /web
# backup restoration, it's safe to run it multiple times
sudo ./scripts/disaster-recovery.sh
```

</details>


<details>
<summary>Recovery of files</summary>

Presume you have a machine with problems, and you want to roll back the changes:

```shell
# restore to directory /web/prod2
# -t 2D means restore from the backup made 2 days
# last argument /web/web/prod2 is the directory to restore to, we're not restoring to the original dir
# so that you can rename it first and then rename this directory to prod
sudo HOME="/home/$(logname)" duplicity -t 2D \
    --no-encryption \
    --s3-endpoint-url https://storage.yandexcloud.net \
    --log-file /web/logs/duplicity.log \
    --archive-dir /root/.cache/duplicity \
    --file-to-restore web/prod  "boto3+s3://favor-group-backup/duplicity_web_favor-group" /web/web/prod2
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>Cleaning redis cache</summary>

Redis is used for site cache and user sessions. To clean it, run the following commands:

```shell
docker exec -uroot -it redis redis-cli FLUSHALL
```

[Here](https://redis.io/commands/) is the complete list of commands you can send to it.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Manual certificate renewal</summary>

DNS verification of a wildcard certificate is set up automatically through [CloudFlare](https://cloudflare.com/) DNS.

To renew the certificate manually, run the following command and follow the interactive prompt:

```shell
docker-compose run --rm --entrypoint "\
  certbot certonly \
    --email email@example.com \
    -d example.com -d *.example.com \
    --agree-tos \
    --manual \
    --preferred-challenges dns" certbot
```

To add required TXT entries, head to DNS entries page of your provider.
